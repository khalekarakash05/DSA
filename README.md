## Overview

This repository includes implementations of common data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, and more. It also covers a variety of algorithms such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and others.

Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in C++ and comes with example usage and test cases to help you understand how to apply them in real-world scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you'll need:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, CLion, Visual Studio)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khalekarakash05/DSA.git
   cd DSA
### Usage

Navigate to the directory of the specific data structure or algorithm you want to run. Each directory contains a main file you can compile and run. For example, to run the binary search tree implementation:

cd DSA/BST
g++ main.cpp -o bst
./bst
